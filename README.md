# PPTP-VPN
PPTP VPN Installer Script


A Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) allows you to implement your own VPN very quickly, and is compatible with most mobile devices. Even though PPTP is less secure than OpenVPN, it is also faster and uses less CPU resources.

Tested on Ubuntu 17.04 (VPS)


## Install
1. Copy script and run `apt install -y git && apt install -y sudo && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debihard/PPTP-VPN/master/install.sh && sudo bash install.sh`
2. Script will ask for username and password for VPN, set them correctly
3. Connect the VPN and Enjoy :)
